//*buyup and *buydown are the buttons to change bulk buy amount, which is represented by *buyamount. *asteroid is the only building affected by bulk buy (other than buyamount changing the cost of all buildings)

Settings
	building cost increase:100%
	building cost refund:0%

Buttons
	*wormhole
		name:Wormhole
		desc:Open up a wormhole to convert all of the matter and dust you have into exotic matter. This will destroy all dust and objects you have, and will use all of your energy.<//><b>Activating a wormhole will give you [pow(dust,0.4)] exotic matter.<b>
		on click:
			yield pow(dust,0.4) exotic
			lose :Buildings
			lose :Upgrades:notTag:essentials
			dust is 25
			energy is 0
			:tag:cooldowns is 0
		end
		req:have generator4
	*convertbutton
		name:Convert Energy
		desc:Activate 10% of your exotic matter, and convert it into energy. This ability has a 1 hour cooldown, and needs [convertcooldown] seconds until it can be used again. Converting right now will give you [pow((exotic/10),0.15)*1000] energy.
		tag:abilities
		on click:
			if (convertcooldown = 0)
				yield pow((exotic/10),0.15)*1000 energy
				lose exotic/10 exotic
				convertcooldown is 3600
			else
				toast Your cooldown needs to be at 0!
			end
		end
		passive:if (convertcooldown > 0) 
	*buyup
		name:Buy x10
		on click:if (buyamount < 101) buyamount is buyamount*10
	*buydown
		name:Buy x0.1
		on click:if (buyamount > 1) buyamount is buyamount*0.1
	*TEMPLATE
		tag:objectbutton
	*asteroidbutton
		name:Create Asteroid (10 dust, 1 energy)
		on click:
			if (dust >= 10 and energy >= 1)
				yield 1 asteroid
				lose 10 dust
				lose 1 energy
			end
		end

Resources
 	*buyamount
		start with:1
		on load:this is 1
		passive:multiply cost of :Buildings by this
	*dust
		name:Dust
		desc:Cosmic dust can be used to make many different celestial objects, however more and more dust is needed to make larger things.
		show earned
		start with:25
		on load:dust is 10
	*energy
		name:Energy
		desc:Energy is essential for making celestial bodies form from gravity power. This energy is often limited, and finding ways to speed up energy production is hard.
	*exotic
		name:Exotic Matter
		desc:Exotic matter obtained from converting normal matter is extremely valuable, boosting your dust earn by an additive 1%. It can also be used to activate special boosts. Dust mass is currently being boosted by x[1+(0.01*this)].
		passive:multiply yield of dust by 1+(0.01*this)
