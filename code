	*wormhole
		name:Wormhole
		desc:Open up a wormhole to convert all of the matter and dust you have into exotic matter. This will destroy all dust and objects you have, and will use all of your energy.<//><b>Activating a wormhole will give you [pow(dust,0.4)/1000] exotic matter.<b>

	*convertbutton
		name:Convert Energy
		desc:Activate 10% of your exotic matter, and convert it into energy. This ability has a 1 hour cooldown, and needs [convertcooldown] seconds until it can be used again. Converting right now will give you [pow((exotic/10),0.15)*1000] energy.

	*matterbutton
		name:Matter Rush
		desc:Activate 5% of your exotic matter, and use it to temporarily amplify the power of your dust production, multiplying dust earned by 10 for 30 seconds. This ability has a 30 minute cooldown, and needs [mattercooldown] seconds until it can be used again.
